1- De Jong's function in 2D: 
	f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2

2- Rosenbrock's function in 2D: 
	f(x, y) = (a - x)^2 + b * (y^2 - x^2)^2
	a and b are constants let a = 1 and b = 100 for example.

3- Rastrigin's function: 
	f(x1 ... xn) = A * n + sigma(i = 1 to n)(Xi^2 - A cos(2 * pi * Xi))

	in 2-D ==> 2 variables:
	f(x1, x2) = A * n + (X1^2 - A * cos(2 * pi * X1)) + (X2^2 - A * cos(2 * pi * X2))
	Where A is a constant let A = 10.

4- Easom's function: 
	f(x, y) = -cos(x) * cos(y) * exp(*((x - pi)^2 + (y - pi)^2))

5- Branins's function:
	f(x1, x2) = a * (X2 - b * X1^2 + c * X1 - r)^2 + s * (1 - t) * cos(X1) + s
	Where:
	a = 1, b = 5.1/(4 * pi^2), c = 5/pi, s = 10, t = 1/(8 * pi)
	and r is a constant let r = 6.
